# 👋🏼 Hello, I'm Xiaohan

#### My name is pronounced as "Show-han".

#### 🌱 Currently making a blockchain audio application, which allow users to upload mp3 files, turn it into a non-fungible token (ERC721 token) and sell this to other users on the application.
I have experience in:
- Javascript (ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS)
- Java
- Solidity
- Typescript
- SQL/NoSQL
- HTML
- CSS

#### 👀 Alongside programming I also like to learn and chase after new disruptions in the technology world. Currently, I am immersed in Web3.0 and blockchain technology through learning Solidity as well as being part of a few prominent projects built on the Ethereum blockchain such as Moonbirds and Veefriends.

#### 📫 My email address is xm00128@gmail.com
