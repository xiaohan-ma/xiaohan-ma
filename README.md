# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Xiaohan

#### My name is pronounced as "Show-han".

#### ðŸŒ± Currently making a blockchain audio application, which allow users to upload mp3 files, turn it into a non-fungible token (ERC721 token) and sell this to other users on the application.
I have experience in:
- Javascript
- Java
- Solidity
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS

#### ðŸ‘€ Alongside learning programming I am also educating myself on a variety of computer science concepts and areas in order to gain broader knowledge regarding the industry. For example, computer networking concepts, cybersecurity and algorithms.

#### ðŸ“š I love, love, love learning new information. From theoretical physics to how society was symbolised as a theatrical play in the Duchess of Malfi, there are always new things to learn about.


#### ðŸ“« My email address is xiaohanma99@hotmail.com
